    "Welcome to `graphai-client`. This package is designed to streamline programmatic interaction with the [GraphAI API](https://graphai.epfl.ch/), taking care of logins, authentication tokens, retries, and asynchronous as well as synchronous endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will take you through a typical use case of the API through the client. Remember that in order to access any of the endpoints, you need to have a GraphAI account, which will give you access to some or all of the endpoint groups."
